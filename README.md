# Wine Quality Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the quality of wines using machine learning techniques. The quality of wine is evaluated based on various chemical properties such as acidity, pH levels, residual sugar, and alcohol content. Accurate prediction of wine quality can help winemakers and sommeliers assess and improve their products.

## Dataset
Kaggle’s Red Wine Quality dataset is used for this project. It consists of a collection of red wine samples, along with their respective quality ratings. The dataset contains various chemical and sensory attributes of the wines, such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, and more.

## Methodology
In this project, we employed a machine learning approach to predict wine quality. For the purpose of this project, I converted the output to a binary output where each wine is either “good quality” (a score of 7 or higher) or not (a score below 7).

## Objective
* To experiment with different classification methods to see which yields the highest accuracy
* To determine which features are the most indicative of a good quality wine
